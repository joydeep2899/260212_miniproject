## INTRODUCTION 

This project implements data compression using huffman coding . i have chosen this project because due to the increased usage of internet , the amount of data that is generated is increasing at an exponential level , According to a recent estimate by idc the amount of data generated evey day in 2021 is 2500 petabytes.

## 4W'S AND 1H'S


 ### WHO 
     this system can be used by developers who are developing chat applications , text editors to compress the whole text content to consume less space and reduce the load on the system 

 ### WHAT 
     many developers and system designers face stiff task when trying to reduce the data from their applications . this increases the cost of maintaing the system since this requires additonal storage and processing power on servers. this leading to cost overruns 

 ### WHERE 
        developers all over the world face this issue when trying to develop new applications .
 ### WHEN
         developers face this issue all the time while developing new chat applications . system designers face this issue while trying to scale the backend of their applications and while creating new system architectures which can support the increased data  from scaling up.
 ### HOW 
       since there has been an increase in the number of users of chat applications and people using text on their phones . this issue has been created as a result of the increased usage of chat applications
